<p>Hopefully something will go here soon.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rundowndeliverables" class="anchor" href="#rundowndeliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rundown/Deliverables</h3>

<p>This is a coding project I have done for my information systems 2A course. It is a multi-form windows desktop application done in C#.
There are three forms. A Login form, and Admin form and A Booking form. The project requires the use of 2 arrays to store show names and cost.
Also, the use a dates is needed in the project.</p>

<h3>
<a id="extras" class="anchor" href="#extras" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extras</h3>

<p>I want to add some cool extras into the project to make it more interesting for me to make.
Something cool with data storage and user accounts - maybe if I have time.</p>

<h2>
<a id="something-else" class="anchor" href="#something-else" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Something else.</h2>

<p>I am using this project as a springboard for an idea I have been playing around with. This is a test-prototype for a new way of working I have been thinking about.
I would like to build a system of working on something that takes ideas from Agile development techniques and applies them to a single person's workflow.
The idea is that system also allows for teamwork but does not rely on it. It should also be quite dynamic and help the user improve their workflows.</p>

<p>What I am doing with this project is using a few project management tools to simulate some major concepts (1 or 2) I have an see if they work in helping me develop this project.
I am using GitHub as my main web app but also <a href="http://waffle.io">http://waffle.io</a> as a work dashboard to track my progress and spec out the project boundaries and deadlines.
I have done these things before but not for something with a definite end and no other team members. Here I want to primarily optimise my workflow and analyse in real-time what is going on.</p>

<h2>
<a id="conclusion--post-mortem" class="anchor" href="#conclusion--post-mortem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion / Post-mortem</h2>

<p>So the project brief is located in the repo - you can read it there.
This method of working is not new for me. In the past I have used whiteboards, paper and Google Keep.
The method succeeds in a few ways. It allows me to break-up complex problems into a set of small steps.
I can also track and monitor what I am doing.
It also makes a project spec much easier to deal with and quicker to do.</p>

<p>There are problems I am hoping to solve with a proper software solution.
The major problem is keeping in the timeframe decided on.
Also scoping correctly at the beginning rather than adding snippets (GitHub issues) during the project implementation phase.
Doing this makes the project naturally grow and leads to feature creep.</p>

<p><img src="http://jasonchalom.com/IS2AMultiFormProject/SomeData/WaffleScreenshot.PNG" alt="Image of Waffle.io">
Waffle IO is not really the correct tool for the job.
That is what I learned from this. The biggest struggle was keeping in the correct time frame which I did not do.

<p>I did run out of time, but this method of working did succeed in a few ways.</p>

<p>I got to complete all the main tasks for this little university project.

<h3>
<a id="appveyor" class="anchor" href="#appveyor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AppVeyor</h3>

<p>AppVeyor as a CI for .net projects is so much better than TravisCI.
TravisCI works well for linux stuff but the setup for .net is quite time consuming and gives you a lot of grief.
AppVeyor took 2 minutes to setup. Point it to the sln file and MSBUILD takes over and uses the correct build setings.</p>
