","body":"# IS2AMultiFormProject - Proper name pending...\r\n\r\n##What this project is:\r\n###The Project.\r\nHopefully something will go here soon.\r\n###Rundown/Deliverables\r\nThis is a coding project I have done for my information systems 2A course. It is a multi-form windows desktop application done in C#.\r\nThere are three forms. A Login form, and Admin form and A Booking form. The project requires the use of 2 arrays to store show names and cost.\r\nAlso, the use a dates is needed in the project.\r\n\r\nWhilst I develop the project it will be a private repository on GitHub, But the Website will be public. When I am done I will make everything public and leave it as an archived experiment / completed university project.\r\n###Extras\r\nI want to add some cool extras into the project to make it more interesting for me to make.\r\nSomething cool with data storage and user accounts - maybe if I have time.\r\n\r\n##Something else.\r\nI am using this project as a springboard for an idea I have been playing around with. This is a test-prototype for a new way of working I have been thinking about.\r\nI would like to build a system of working on something that takes ideas from Agile development techniques and applies them to a single person's workflow.\r\nThe idea is that system also allows for teamwork but does not rely on it. It should also be quite dynamic and help the user improve their workflows.\r\n\r\nWhat I am doing with this project is using a few project management tools to simulate some major concepts (1 or 2) I have an see if they work in helping me develop this project.\r\nI am using GitHub as my main web app but also http://waffle.io as a work dashboard to track my progress and spec out the project boundaries and deadlines.\r\nI have done these things before but not for something with a definite end and no other team members. Here I want to primarily optimise my workflow and analyse in real-time what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIN.\r\n----\r\n","google":"UA-46778548-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
