","body":"# IS2AMultiFormProject - Proper name pending...\r\n\r\n##What this project is:\r\n###The Project.\r\nHopefully something will go here soon.\r\n###Rundown/Deliverables\r\nThis is a coding project I have done for my information systems 2A course. It is a multi-form windows desktop application done in C#.\r\nThere are three forms. A Login form, and Admin form and A Booking form. The project requires the use of 2 arrays to store show names and cost.\r\nAlso, the use a dates is needed in the project.\r\n###Extras\r\nI want to add some cool extras into the project to make it more interesting for me to make.\r\nSomething cool with data storage and user accounts - maybe if I have time.\r\n\r\n##Something else.\r\nI am using this project as a springboard for an idea I have been playing around with. This is a test-prototype for a new way of working I have been thinking about.\r\nI would like to build a system of working on something that takes ideas from Agile development techniques and applies them to a single person's workflow.\r\nThe idea is that system also allows for teamwork but does not rely on it. It should also be quite dynamic and help the user improve their workflows.\r\n\r\nWhat I am doing with this project is using a few project management tools to simulate some major concepts (1 or 2) I have an see if they work in helping me develop this project.\r\nI am using GitHub as my main web app but also http://waffle.io as a work dashboard to track my progress and spec out the project boundaries and deadlines.\r\nI have done these things before but not for something with a definite end and no other team members. Here I want to primarily optimise my workflow and analyse in real-time what is going on.\r\n\r\n##Conclusion / Post-mortem\r\nSo the project brief is located in the repo - you can read it there.\r\nThis method of working is not new for me. In the past I have used whiteboards, paper and Google Keep.\r\nThe method succeeds in a few ways. It allows me to break-up complex problems into a set of small steps.\r\nI can also track and monitor what I am doing.\r\nIt also makes a project spec much easier to deal with and quicker to do.\r\n\r\nThere are problems I am hoping to solve with a proper software solution.\r\nThe major problem is keeping in the timeframe decided on.\r\nAlso scoping correctly at the beginning rather than adding snippets (GitHub issues) during the project implementation phase.\r\nDoing this makes the project naturally grow and leads to feature creep.\r\n\r\n###Waffle.IO\r\n![Image of Waffle.io](http://jasonchalom.com/IS2AMultiFormProject/SomeData/WaffleScreenshot.PNG)\r\nWaffle IO is not really the correct tool for the job.\r\nThat is what I learned from this. The biggest struggle was keeping in the correct time frame which I did not do.\r\n![Image of GitHub Milestones](http://jasonchalom.com/IS2AMultiFormProject/SomeData/Milestones.PNG)\r\n\r\nI did run out of time, but this method of working did succeed in a few ways.\r\n\r\nI got to complete all the main tasks for this little university project.\r\n![Image of GitHub Issues](http://jasonchalom.com/IS2AMultiFormProject/SomeData/Issues.PNG)\r\n\r\n###AppVeyor\r\nAppVeyor as a CI for .net projects is so much better than TravisCI.\r\nTravisCI works well for linux stuff but the setup for .net is quite time consuming and gives you a lot of grief.\r\nAppVeyor took 2 minutes to setup. Point it to the sln file and MSBUILD takes over and uses the correct build setings.\r\n\r\nFIN.\r\n----\r\n","google":"UA-46778548-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
